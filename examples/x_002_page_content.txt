Page Content
============

The content of this page is located in a separate txt file, written with MarkDown syntax.

We use the Markdown & Extra engine Copyright (c) 2004-2009 Michel Fortin  <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>, based on the original Markdown Copyright (c) 2004-2006 John Gruber <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>.

----

You add the resulting HTML5 to a <tt>TPage</tt> object with a simple call to the <tt>load()</tt> method. The class then uses markdown to interpret the file content.
